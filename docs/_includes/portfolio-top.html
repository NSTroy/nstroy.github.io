<p>Producing well-built, clearly understood systems in the course of relentless, real-world problem-solving has been my focus as a software engineer. I’ve programmed hardware to the metal, developed GNC code for SpaceX’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/">SuperHeavy</a> booster, contributed 16 years of enhancements to Apple’s <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/">AppKit</a> framework, implemented 3D game rendering and art pipelines, built advanced device drivers and <a target="_blank" href="https://coherencelabs.com/typemetal/">a revolutionary HTML+WordPress editor for macOS</a>, and helped app teams troubleshoot complex problems and build new features. I’ve been a conference speaker and mentor to other developers, have enjoyed working with amazing people, and welcome new challenges and opportunities.</p>
