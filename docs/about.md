## My Background

I’m grateful for rare experiences that have included:

- 16 years at Apple helping evolve macOS’ [AppKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/) framework
- a stint on the SpaceX [Starship](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/) team, developing flight software for the SuperHeavy booster
- getting to create [TypeMetal](https://coherencelabs.com/typemetal/): a unique visual HTML editor and WordPress client for macOS
- some video game development a while back -- focusing on in-game realtime 3D rendering, adaptive animation, and building art production tools and preprocessing pipelines
- getting my start with lots of low-level hacking on early PCs

## Current Goals

- Share useful perspective that these experiences have brought me, along with a bit of code now and then.
- Make sure that the most valuable lessons of the best programming and software systems I’ve had the opportunity to work with -- the things I've most enjoyed and been inspired by -- will be preserved and understood, and will live on in current and future systems.
- Improve our ability to efficiently express and rapidly develop robust and useful software.
- Improve the longevity of our most important work: Make code that's more portable and resilient to system changes. Build software of enduring use and value.
- Build decentralized systems that support data independence and personal sovereignty, and serve the individual purposes of maximally resilient and independent people.
- Leverage well-designed automation to speed development cycles and improve our reach.
