		<p class="description">Developed the rendering code for the Sony PlayStation version of a PC/PlayStation baseball game, based on an in-house 3D engine that provides basic polygonal rendering and skeletal animation of seamless mesh characters. Implemented realtime retexturing of player meshes, runtime IK/attachment mirroring for handedness, viewspace LOD selection, and a priority allocation system for managing limited main memory and texture VRAM resources. Implemented subdivision rendering to alleviate texture warping. Developed the art build pipeline and custom tools atop an existing art-processing tool base. Worked closely with ten artists and one art director to ensure technical compliance of game art and provide support for in-house tools, including a 3DS Max2 exporter and standalone model viewer. Was offered a lead position to follow this project, but Radical Vancouver closed its San Francisco office in September ’98.</p>
